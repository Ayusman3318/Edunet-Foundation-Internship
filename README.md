# Edunet-Foundation-Internship

During this internship, I worked on handling real-time data and developing a sustainable machine learning system using Python and its libraries.

As part of the project, I built a **Crop and Fertilizer Prediction System** using a **Decision Tree Classifier**. The system predicts the most suitable crop to grow based on soil and environmental parameters, and recommends the appropriate fertilizers to maximize productivity.

The model achieved an accuracy of **99%** on the test dataset.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Jupyter Notebook

## Features
- Crop prediction based on soil nutrients and environmental conditions
- Fertilizer recommendation for optimal yield
- Real-time data handling and processing

## Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience with real-time datasets
- Learned end-to-end machine learning project development
- Improved skills in data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation
